This Addon simulates solar systems according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. It will calculate the orbit of the simulated objects based on given parameters (the so called "orbital elements") specified in the physics tab.

[B]Overview:[/B]
The Addon creates panels in three different areas:
For global adjustments (of time and dimensions) there is a panel in the Scene-Tab:
[LIST]
[*]Adjust the simulation time (the property is called "Evaluation Time") with keyframes.
[*]Change the scaling of lengths (the solar system is really big) and time (planets need long for their orbit).
[/LIST]

For every object there is a panel in the Physics-Tab:
The object can have three different types (Center, Planet or Surface).
[LIST]
[*]A Center object is the basis for a solar system.
[*]Planets orbit around this center or around other planets (like the Moon). The orbit and the rotation of a planet is controlled through the Orbit- and Rotation-panels.
[*]Surface objects are the visible shell of the planets. They are just parented Mesh-Spheres which move and rotate with their planet.
[/LIST]

The 3D-View Toolbar has a panel with some useful operators for making surface objects, planets and solar systems. The orbits can be drawn in the Viewport together with additional information for the active object.

For animating the movements and rotations a custom driver is used. You can make Animation Curves for location and rotation which are saved in the blend-file by using the Calculation-panel or the "Bake All" Operator from the Toolbar.

[B]Short manual for creating the Earth orbiting the Sun:[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]Install the Addon, in Blender you will find it in the object category.
[*]Every Solar System needs a center object. Go to the 3D-View Toolbar and hit the "Create Center"-button.
[*]In the popup window set "Center Name" to "Sun", "Mass (kg)" to 2, "Mass Exponent" to 30 (The Sun's mass is about 2*10^30 kg). The Sun needs 25 days for one rotation around its axis, set "Rotation Period (in seconds)" to 25 * 24 * 60 * 60, Blender will do the calculation. Enable "Create Surface" and set "Radius (in km)" to 6.955, "Radius Exponent" to 5 (the Sun's radius is about 695,500 km = 6.955*10^5 km).
[*]The operator will create one empty object (named "Sun") at the origin together with a Mesh-Sphere (named "Sun_surface"). Make sure the "Sun"-Empty is the active object (tip: alt-rightmousebutton on the Sun) and use the "Create Planet"-button from the toolbar.
[*]In the popup window the "Center" property will be set to the active object (in this case "Sun"). The name for the planet will be "Earth". The Earth's mass is about 5.98*10^24 kg, the distance from the Sun is about 149.6 million km. Set "Distance (in km)" to 149.6 and leave the exponent at 6. The Earth's rotation period is 1 day = 86,400 seconds and its radius is 6,370 km (= 6.37*10^3 km). A new planet far away from the Sun will be created, you have to zoom out to see it.
[*]In the Toolbar hit the button "Add Time FCurve". When you start the animation with alt-a, the Earth will move around the Sun. Enable the "Draw Orbit" property in the toolbar to see the orbit.
[*]To refine the orbit of the Earth select it (the empty not the mesh object) and go to the physics-tab. To make the Earth's orbit slightly elliptic go to the "Orbit"-panel and set the "Eccentricity"-property to 0.02. Also the rotation axis of the Earth is tilted by 23.4Â°. In the "Rotation"-panel adjust the "Axis Tilt"-property.
[*]To add more surfaces to the Earth (e.g. a cloud layer slightly bigger than 6,370 km) use the "Create Surface"-button from the Toolbar. If you want to UV-Unwrap the meshes better use a UV-Sphere as Surface Mesh Type.
[*]To change the scaling of the solar system go to the scene-tab. The "Solar System Simulator: Scene Data"-Panel contains global settings like the Simulation Time (animate the "Evaluation Time" property for speeding up or slowing down the simulation) and properties for scaling of lengths and time. The "Planet Size Multiplier" increases the size of the surfaces without changing the distance between planets and center.
[*]If you want to save the orbit in the file, use the "Bake All" operator from the toolbar. For every simulation object it will create a location and rotation FCurve which is saved in the blend-file.
[/LIST]


[B]Notes:[/B]
[LIST]
[*]The Empties created by the operators from the toolbar act as a backbone. They are the animated objects, the surfaces are just parented to them.
[*]The addon will add two custom drivers to blenders driver namespace. If you rename a simulation object or save a blend-file with a simulation using the driver and reopen it later, it will not work anymore.
To fix this activate the addon (if not already) and use the "Update Drivers" button from the toolbar or the Scene-tab. This will update the namespace and all drivers of simulated objects in the current scene. 
[*]You can create FCurves for individual objects from the "Calculation"-panel in the physics-tab. First you have to disable the driver then you can use the "SSSim To F-Curve" button.
"Cyclic" works correctly only if the "Evaluation Time" property of the scene is linear, if you have set custom keyframes, better disable it and set start and end frame. 
[*]By default the "Bake All" operator from the toolbar will override the frame_step setting of each planet. This is not useful if some planets (with very elliptical orbits) need more keyframes than others.
[*]Be careful when you rename objects, relations to other objects (surfaces, planets around this planet) may get invalid.
[*]You can set the orbital period or the rotation period in frames. In case of the orbital period you have to activate "Use User Orbital Period" first.
[*]In case of problems have a look at the console (On Windows: Window -> Toggle System Console), some information is printed there.

I'm new to Python and the Blender API and I got most my information from Wikipedia. If you have suggestions on how to improve the addon, make it easier to use, fix some lines of codes or just found an interesting website about planets, post it here.
